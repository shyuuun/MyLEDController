# Features to be Planned

This document outlines planned features for the LED Controller project.

## Web Interface Features

### Current Status
- Basic web server running on ESP32
- Simple on/off control for LEDs
- Access Point mode for device connection

### Planned Features

#### Control Panel
- [ ] Real-time LED strip preview/visualization
- [ ] Color picker for custom colors
- [ ] Brightness slider (0-255)
- [ ] Speed control for effects
- [ ] Power on/off toggle

#### LED Effects
- [ ] Static color mode
- [ ] Rainbow cycle
- [ ] Color fade/breathing
- [ ] Theater chase
- [ ] Sparkle/twinkle
- [ ] Fire effect
- [ ] Custom patterns
- [ ] Effect presets/favorites

#### Configuration
- [ ] WiFi settings page (AP mode + Station mode)
- [ ] LED strip configuration (number of LEDs, layout)
- [ ] Matrix configuration (width x height)
- [ ] Save/load presets
- [ ] Device name customization

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] Schedule/timer functionality (turn on/off at specific times)
- [ ] Music reactive mode (with microphone input)
- [ ] Multiple zone control for different LED sections
- [ ] REST API for third-party integrations
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates

#### User Interface
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Touch-friendly controls
- [ ] Status indicators (WiFi, errors, current effect)

## Device Features

### Hardware Integration
- [ ] IR remote control support
  - [ ] Power on/off
  - [ ] Effect selection
  - [ ] Brightness control
  - [ ] Color selection
- [ ] Physical button controls (optional)

### Error Handling
- [x] Error code system using LEDs
  - [x] 2 Red LEDs - Filesystem initialization failure
  - [x] 3 Red LEDs - Access Point creation failure
  - [x] 4 Red LEDs - Web server initialization failure
  - [x] 5 Red LEDs - WiFi connection failure
  - [x] 2 Yellow LEDs - File not found

### Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Smooth transitions between effects
- [ ] Memory optimization for ESP32 S2
- [ ] OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates
- [ ] Configuration backup to filesystem
- [ ] Fast boot time optimization

### Network Features
- [ ] mDNS support (discover device as ledcontroller.local)
- [ ] Station mode (connect to existing WiFi)

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Multiple LED strip support

## Priority Levels

### High Priority
1. LED effects implementation
2. Web interface improvements (color picker, brightness control)
3. WiFi station mode for existing network connection

### Medium Priority
1. IR remote control
2. Schedule/timer functionality
3. OTA updates
4. REST API

### Low Priority
2. Mobile app
3. Cloud features
4. Home automation integration
