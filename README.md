# LED Controller

-   I have this WS2812b LED strip laying around and I wanted to use it in my room. The problem is I don't have a controller for it yet
    So I decided to make one myself using an ESP32 S2 mini.

## Project Details

-   Microcontroller: ESP32 S2 Mini
-   LED Strip: WS2812b (60 LEDs)
  -   Currently configured for a 5x5 matrix, but can be adjusted in the code
-   Power Supply: 5V 10A
-   Libraries Used: FastLED, Arduino
